# List the things you added for points
# [+2] Include more than eight passages
#    [+1] Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item
#    [+1] Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa)
#    [+1] Keep track of visited passages and only display the description when visiting for the first time (or requested)
